The exemption renewal allows DECS members that employ commercial driver's license (CDL) holders to conduct a limited query of the Clearinghouse before hiring a driver for a project. If the limited query indicates that information about the driver exists in the Clearinghouse, the driver is not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions unless and until a full query subsequently shows that the driver is not prohibited from operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV).
